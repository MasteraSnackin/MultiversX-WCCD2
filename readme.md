# MultiversX Token Issuer

This project contains a Python script designed to issue fungible tokens on the MultiversX blockchain. The script automates the process of issuing tokens to specific accounts, where each account receives 100 million tokens with a unique ticker starting with "WINTER-...".

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **MultiversX SDK**: Install the Python SDK for MultiversX to interact with the blockchain:

  ```bash
  pip install multiversx_sdk
A MultiversX Wallet: You'll need access to the wallet's private key for transaction signing. Ensure this is stored securely.
Project Structure
issue_tokens.py: The main script responsible for issuing the tokens.
README.md: This document, providing an overview and instructions.
.gitignore: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
Setup and Configuration
Clone the Repository:

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiversx-token-issuer.git
cd multiversx-token-issuer
Configure the Script:

Open issue_tokens.py and configure the following:

Issuer Address and Private Key:

Replace your_issuer_address_here with your actual issuer account address.
Replace your_issuer_private_key_here with your issuer's private key or specify the path to your PEM file.
Accounts List:

Update the accounts list with the actual addresses of the accounts that will receive the tokens.
Usage
To run the script and issue tokens, execute the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy
python issue_tokens.py
Ensure that your Python environment is activated and configured correctly to include all dependencies.

How It Works
Token Issuance:

The script creates a transaction for each account specified in the accounts list.
It encodes the token issuance data, signs the transaction using the issuer's private key, and sends it to the MultiversX network.
Transaction Details:

The transaction includes details such as token name, ticker, initial supply, and decimal precision.
Notes and Best Practices
Security: Keep your private keys secure and never hard-code them into your scripts. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults.
Testing: Use the testnet environment for initial testing before deploying on the mainnet.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage network issues and transaction failures gracefully.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues:

Invalid Address: Ensure that all account addresses are correctly formatted and valid.
Insufficient Funds: Check that the issuer account has enough EGLD to cover issuance costs and transaction fees.
Debugging Tips:

Use print statements or logging to track the flow of execution and identify where issues may arise.
Verify network connectivity and endpoint availability.
